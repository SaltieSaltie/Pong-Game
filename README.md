# Pong-Game
Remaking the original Pong game from 1972 so I can learn Unity. The files are from the Unity Project but the game can be installed too from here by using the installer.

<b>Install instructions:<b>
Firstly, download the installer for the game.

Then go through the standard procedure of downloading the game through the install wizard.

NOTE: Windows may falsely flag the installer as a threat, it's NOT a threat. If it does come up with a threat notification just click on "Run anyway" and continue the installation.
